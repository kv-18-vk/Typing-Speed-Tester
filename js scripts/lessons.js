    content: `As you begin these typing lessons, remember to focus on accuracy. The first principle of touch typing is to always return your fingers to the home row when you are not typing.<br>The home row will be the reference point from which you will learn the positions of all the other keys. Most keyboards have small bumps on the f and j keys to help you find the home row without looking at the keys.<br>Position your right hand so that your index finger is placed on j, your middle finger is on k, your ring finger is on l and your pinky is on ;(semi-colon). Let your right thumb rest comfortably on the spacebar at the bottom of the keyboard.
<br>Your hand should be raised above the keyboard with your fingers curving down to point directly on the keys.<br>Position your left hand so that your index finger is on f, your middle finger is on d, your ring finger is on s and your pinky is on a. Your thumb can rest on the spacebar.`

The <strong>comma</strong>, <strong>period</strong>, and <strong>forward slash</strong> are the bottom row keys for the right hand middle finger, ring finger and pinky, respectively.<br>The <strong>colon</strong> is the alternate character for the semi-colon key. To type it, just press the key with your right pinky finger while holding the left shift key.<br><strong>Apostrophe</strong> and the <strong>double quotation mark</strong>( ' " ) - Both characters use the same key. To reach it, extend your right pinky finger to the key directly to the right. The double quote is typed while holding the left shift key and the apostrophe is typed without it.<br>The <strong>question mark</strong> is the secondary character for the /, which you have already learned. To type it, move your right pinky down to the bottom row and hold the left shift key.<br>You will type the <strong>exclamation</strong> point character with the left pinky, reaching above and to the left of the q key, while holding the right shift key.<br>The <strong>hyphen</strong> is typed with the right pinky finger, reaching up and to the right of the p key.`
